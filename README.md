# **Head Pose Estimation** 


![Head Pose Estimation](https://github.com/MarwanMohamed95/Head-Pose-Estimation/blob/main/Test%20Output.gif)

- In this project we will draw the 3 position axis (pitch,yaw,roll) by predicting the 3 angels of each position by training 3 models to predict each angel. 
- We will use [AFLW2000](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/projects/3DDFA/Database/AFLW2000-3D.zip) dataset with contains 2000 image and 2000 matlab file with contains the landmark points of each face in the images.
- We will use dlib library for detecting the face and then predicting the landmarks of the face for predicting the 3 angels in testing phase.     


## Steps of the notebook:
    - 1. Importing Libraries. 
    - 2. Loading Data, Face Detector, Landmarks Predictor. 
    - 3. Function for drawing the 3 axis on the image (X,Y,Z).
    - 4. Preparing the Data for training.
    - 5. Defining the model.
    - 6. Testing the models on images from the datasets and comparing their results with the true labels.
    - 7. Testing the models on test video and drawing the 3 axis.
